Yesterday the 2020 edition of PHPDay was held in a remote fashion https://2020.phpday.it/talks.html.

Having experienced the 2019 edition (indeed my first one, despite being a PHP developer from eons!) I should say that it was a little difficult to maintain the concentration for such a long event, but the effort was well worth of, given the level of both lecturers and talks.

I would like to thanks the folks at Grups https://www.grusp.org/ for their passionate work. Try to sustain them!

What follows is a mere recap of yesterday, with my little bit of comments. 


**Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Playing Developer by _Gary Hockin_**

A trip into developers' mindset from a ludic (and hence, engaging) viewpoint. Gary is a natural born speaker ;) and this talk deserves to be seen by anyone interested in programming, no matter their background and interests, at least once. 

**What's new in PHP 8 by _Derick Rethans_**

Personally, I did not like the style of the presentation (not the theme of slides, but how they got presented! :D) but the information provided is very important and so you should take a look here: https://derickrethans.nl/talks/php-phpday20 

**Symfony 5, the new bit by _Andreas Hucks_**

A deep dive into Symfony 5 features and enhancements. Definitely to understand in order to evolve our software: we won't take dead ends if we know where the developers of our framework of choice are heading. Right?

**Leveraging Typed Exceptions for Cleaner Error Handling by _Chris Holland_**

A talk suited mostly to entry-level/mid-level developers, but indeed useful to learn (or recap) how to establish a lifelong relationship with exceptions: they are not enemies, they can help us contextualizing the scope in which they occur and so speed up the debugging process.

**Kubernetes for PHP developers by _Alessandro Lai_**

A well-presented talk by my colleague Alessandro - Too much dashboard screenshot for me, but that's only because I am more dev than ops ;)

**Technically Speaking: Improve your code with documentation by _Alexandra White_**

Brilliantly presented by Alexandra! A tidbit that I brought home: there are moments to be (like) Shakespeare and others not. One of those when not to be Shakespeare is when writing documentation.
I must say that this talk lighted my interest in technical writing.
The cherry on the cake was that the presentation had subtitles, which should definitely become a de-facto standard at least for pre-recorded videos. Very inclusive!

**Looping the Loop with SPL Iterators by _Mark Baker_**

A tour of the not-well-known iterators world and a little mea-culpa about the initially almost-not-existent SPL documentation! ðŸ™‚

**Getting started with ReactPHP â€“ Pushing real-time data to the browser by _Christian LÃ¼ck_**

This is the real React! Not that other little thingy made by Facebook! An introductive talk to the react world and the world is based on: async and event-driven programming and of course promises (https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1Z65OMi1Y&feature=gws_kp_track), 

**Pragmatic Optimism: How PHP Conquered the Web by Pragmatic Optimism: How PHP Conquered the Web by _Samantha QuiÃ±ones_**

I really enjoyed the final talk that was a historic retrospective of the web development, starting from Charles Babbage up to (fast forward) CGI, the Personal Home Page Tools - PHP Tools and its evolution.
There was a point in this talk worth mentioning: sometimes people are ashamed to tell others they are using PHP because of (insert here any drawback you heard of - probably already fixed by now).
The fact is: why we should be ashamed by declaring we are using PHP? Every problem could be sorted out by several approaches and tools, some better than others.
Well, pragmatically, PHP is a tool that helps us solve our problems for a very long time and have demonstrated to listen to its community and to evolve.
I liked the comparison with CoBOL: at the time it was published it was the perfect tool to program business applications, because the alternative were more or lest not-existent (unless you would go low-level).
So, CoBol was the right tool at the right time. At still it is... (that's because big companies find cheaper to maintain their big underdocumented monoliths than re-engineering it, but this is another story).

So, let's be proud to be PHP developers, and let's the 2021 PHPDay edition could be held in person in Verona!
