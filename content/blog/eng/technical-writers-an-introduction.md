# The technical writer, this mysterious character

Let's face it, being a technical writer (especially in Italy) makes you feel a bit like [Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Stinson): no one knows what your real job is. If you're a tech writer, I bet you have at least one relative who, at every family gathering, asks you "What do you exactly do for a living?". In the most desperate cases, even your mom doesn't know what your job is!


Therefore, in this post I will try to profile technical writers. I will talk about the main objectives, the working method, the necessary skills of a technical writer. Finally, I will briefly describe the figure of the Technical Writer @ Facile.it.

# Foreword

Before going any further, a few things need to be clarified. First, it is important to note that the hard skills needed by technical writers vary by industry. For example, a technical writer working in the mechanical engineering industry needs some different hard skills from a technical writer working in the IT industry.  

In addition, unlike other professionals, technical writers working in the same industry often have very different academic and work backgrounds. 
The heterogeneity of backgrounds is particularly evident in Italy since there is not yet an academic path dedicated to technical writing, so this profession is learned through courses and experience. Instead, some universities outside of Italy offer bachelor's and master's degrees in technical writing. This makes the profession more widespread and recognized abroad.

However, a generic profile of the tech writer can be defined. In fact, we can say that the soft skills needed by technical writers are cross-cutting and do not change based on the industry. Moreover, there are some fundamental hard skills that every technical writer should possess, regardless of the business sector.


Given these premises, I and the technical writing team at Facile.it felt the need to write this post to get ourselves known and to unveil a few mysteries. In fact, we are aware that the technical writer role needs a little introduction.


# Main goals of a tech writer

Regardless of what industry you work in and what product you write about, one of the main goals of a tech writer is to make complexity (of a product, process, etc.) less complex. 

However, I believe that simplifying complexity is a necessary step toward achieving a greater goal, perhaps **the** goal of technical writers, which is to help other colleagues, the users of a product, or anyone who might benefit from documentation. The primary goal of our work should always be to relieve people of the difficulty and frustration that comes from a lack of knowledge sharing. I like to think that the technical writer's work, in its own way, is altruistic work. 

I talked about _knowledge_ above because, if we wanted to summarize our work, we could say that our mission is to capture the knowledge of said products or processes and make it available to colleagues or to external users (e.g. partners or customers). In fact, this knowledge is often scattered within the company and often relies on oral tradition. This creates disaffection among a company's employees, among its partners, and among its customers.


# How does a technical writer typically work?

Now let's try to understand what actions a tech writer usually performs. Of course, the work processes and procedures vary depending on the methodologies applied by the company and the team to which the writer belongs. The following actions identify the main tasks of a technical writer. 

1. Gather materials needed for the task/project.
2. Plan the work for the task/project.
3. Study the material available.
4. If necessary, "play around" with the product to analyze it and begin to learn about it.
5. Interview Subject Matter Experts (SME) to understand how the product/process to be documented works.
6. Interview some of the possible users and stakeholders of the documentation to learn about their needs.
7. Begin writing the documentation.
8. Conduct additional research and/or schedule additional meetings with SMEs.
9. Write some more...and more.
10. Request revisions and implement revisions.
11. Publish documentation.


# What are the hard skills needed by a tech writer? 

As mentioned earlier, hard skills change by industry. However, **in general** for a technical writer it is helpful to:
- Know how to use **CMSs and text editing tools** that are specific to technical writing (e.g. Flare, Paligo, Confluence, Oxygen, FrameMaker, etc.)
- Know how to use **image and video editing tools** (e.g. Snagit, Illustrator, Photoshop etc.)
- Know **HTML, XML, and CSS**. A basic knowledge may be sufficient.
- Have an **excellent level of English**, if you are not a native speaker.
- Know the rules of [Simplified Technical English](http://www.asd-ste100.org/) and other controlled languages (e.g. [Italiano Tecnico Semplificato](https://www.italianotecnicosemplificato.it/cose-its/#page-content)).
- Have good **project management skills**.

For technical writers working in the **IT industry**, it is also helpful to:

- Know **Markdown** and/or **reStructuredText**.
- Know **Git** and the Docs-as-Code approach, a basic knowledge of Git may be sufficient.
- Know how to write **API documentation**.
- Know some **modelling standards** (e.g. UML, C4, BPMN).
- Know how to work with **Agile methodology**.

Obviously, each person possesses and practices each skill at different levels, depending on their aptitude and personal tastes. It is not necessary to have perfect knowledge of everything listed above. 

Certainly, as with many other jobs, two key aspects of a technical writer's professional life are training and keeping up to date with industry news. There are many ways to achieve these goals, for example: online courses, attending conferences, joining industry associations, reading trade journals.

# What are the soft skills needed by a tech writer? 

After talking about purely technical aspects, let's try to focus on personal qualities and see what soft skills technical writers must possess. It goes without saying that even in terms of soft skills, a technical writer is not expected to master all of these skills to the highest level. 

**Whatever the industry** they work in, these are the **main soft skills** that are useful to technical writers:

- Ability to create and maintain relationships
- Ability to mediate
- Ability to learn quickly
- Curiosity
- Adaptability
- Time management
- Precision and attention to details
- Proactive listening
- Courage to ask for help when necessary


# Tech writers @ Facile.it

I will conclude by describing the reality in which I work on a daily basis. I will briefly tell you about the technical writing team of Facile.it. 

Since Facile.it is constantly evolving and growing, also our team and its organization will surely change in the future. In fact our goal, as well as that of the company, is to constantly improve. Therefore, we do not claim to be a perfect model, we are constantly self-critical and we are aware that there are many realities out there from which we can learn. 

However, in the meantime we are pleased to introduce ourselves and tell you a little about us.

## Our team within the company

Our team is part of the IT department, more specifically we are part of a bigger cross-functional team called _Platform Team_.  From our positioning within the company, it is easy to understand that we work in support of the other teams in the IT department and that we are a link between the IT department and other "worlds" within the company, for example the Marketing, Product, and Business departments.

## What we do 

These are the main activities we handle:

- Recover the documentation debt for old projects, when needed for refactoring and decision making.
- Create documentation for new projects. These documentation can be strictly technical but can also include business aspects.
- Create ready-to-use standard indexes and templates for colleagues (e.g. an index for software project documentation, a template for the documentation of microservices).
- Provide consulting to colleagues who ask us for advice by giving them suggestions and links to tools that may be useful.

## What we do not do

On the other hand, these are the activities we do **not** handle:

- Create day-by-day documentation that is in charge of each team (e.g. meeting notes, minutes of retrospectives, maintenance documentation, release notes).
- Proofreading and editing. We are available for suggestions and minor changes to documents written by others but we do not carry out review projects.
- Create documentation for marketing/commercial communication.

## How we plan and organize our activities

Our team plans quarter-by-quarter activities, trying to align with business needs as much as possible. 

However, as I said above, the company is constantly evolving and growing, and I can't deny that sudden changes have sometimes interfered with the planning of our activities. We didn't lose heart over it, though. We spent a team retrospective to figure out how we could improve our processes and anticipate needs in the best possible way. 

Therefore, we created a form through which technical writing requests can be submitted and we provided instructions on how to fill it out.  Through this form it is possible to request the creation, updating, and correction of documentation. The requests received will be analyzed and discussed by the team before being taken up, put on hold or rejected. Currently, we plan to activate the form for two weeks straddling two quarters. 

We chose to follow this approach because the current size of the Technical writing team does not yet allow to allocate a technical writer to one or a few IT teams. Not being able to follow the daily activities of a team, we looked for a solution that would allow us to know the "macro-needs" of our colleagues in advance. 
Is this the best approach ever? Probably not but it is the approach that best fits the current organization and structure of our team within the company. 

# Conclusion

With this article, I and the Technical Writing team at Facile.it hope to have helped you learn more about our profession and to have made you a little curious. 
Of course, this article does not aspire to be exhaustive since it has been written based on our personal experiences and points of view. 
However, we are pleased to contribute to the definition and knowledge of this profession that can offer many opportunities and is constantly growing and evolving.
