      <description>Today I want to talk about living documentation, having just finished the aptly-named book by Cyrille Martraire, Living Documentation: continuous knowledge sharing by design, published by Pearson.

  Wasted time (finding the missing points or guessing them).
  Biased decisions due to this lack.
  Hint: when you donâ€™t know something, you are usually not aware that you don&amp;rsquo;t know it ;)</description>
