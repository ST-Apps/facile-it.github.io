      <description>This year, Facile attended for the first time Lambda Days Conference in the beautiful polish city of Krakow. It has been a two-days full immersion with speakers coming from all over the world. The latest trends and academic research in the functional world were showcased, spanning from beginner&amp;rsquo;s approaches to functional languages to highly specific scientific applications. This conference was totally worth attending, albeit very intense (sometimes mind-bending, actually!). All the talks were of high quality and the organization was perfect.</description>
