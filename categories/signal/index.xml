      <description>Last time we looked at the Signal class, that is, a simple, reusable way of encapsulating the observer pattern. There are many use cases for a signal, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to show one possible application, spawned from a real-world problem. View controllers&amp;rsquo; composition and decoupling is hard: we often need an input from a view controller, that has to send its input back to its creator, while handling the back navigation somehow.</description>
