      <description>The goal of this article is to define basic concepts related to testing, trying not to take anything for granted.
Why do we test?? Why is it important to write automated tests? I asked myself and I did some research because the answer to this question was not obvious to me. I knew it was important but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why. So, I decided to try to explain it starting from a point of view as impartial as possible.</description>
