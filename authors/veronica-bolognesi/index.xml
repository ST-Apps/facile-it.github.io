      <description>The 2020 edition of PHPDay took place on September 8th in a remote fashion.
Having experienced the 2019 edition (indeed my first one, despite being a PHP developer from eons!) I would say that it was a little difficult to stay focused for such a long event. However, given the high-quality level of lecturers and talks, it was totally worth the effort.
I would like to thank the folks at Grusp for their passionate work.</description>
